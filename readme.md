While working on the project, dynamically save/update build of project using watch command:

Once you build the project, it will generate the relevant files to get this project working as a Chrome Extension.

You will need import the folder containing the project as a [developer chrome extension](https://bashvlas.com/blog/install-chrome-extension-in-developer-mode/) to get it working on chrome once you've built it using webpack.

This project will only show up on `github.com/*` pages that have a contribution calendar.
